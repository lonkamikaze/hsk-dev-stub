/**

\mainpage HSK Electronic Device Manual

This project is a stub to clone when starting the development of a new
device.

The default location for hsk_libs, which is required for compiling,
is ../hsk_libs. Changing it without tracking it is possible by
adjusting \c LIBDIR and \c INCDIR by setting them in \c Makefile.local.

After setting the new project up, run \c uVisionupdate.sh to update the
µVision project file. The \c uVisionupdate.sh script also generates
the list of ISR callbacks for µVision's call tree/overlaying engine.

The list generation only recognizes direct assignments to
<tt>hsk_isr\<number>.\<SOURCE></tt> and calls to <tt>hsk_timer[01]_setup()</tt>.
More complex assignments might require an update of
<tt>scripts/overlays.awk</tt>.
