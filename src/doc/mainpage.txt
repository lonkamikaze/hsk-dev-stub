/**

\mainpage HSK Electronic Device Manual

This project is a stub to clone when starting the development of a new
device.

The default location for hsk_libs, which is required for compiling,
is ../hsk_libs. Changing it without tracking it is possible by
adjusting \c LIBDIR and \c INCDIR by setting them in \c Makefile.local.

After setting the new project up, run \c uVisionsetup.sh to adopt the
ÂµVision project file.
